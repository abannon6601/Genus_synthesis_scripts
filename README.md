# Cadence Genus synthesis script
This script was pulled together from multiple sources around the web. I've included options to make it easy to read in a large number of HDL files.
The code is pretty self-explanatory. Replace every field surrounded by <> with your own files, paths, and settings.

**NOTE:** 
For this script to work genus must be running in legacy mode. To do this, start Genus and enter the command <code>"set_db common_ui false"</code>. From there run the script with the command <code>"source <script_name>.tcl"</code>
